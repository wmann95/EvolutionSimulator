# OpenGLStuff
Hello! This is a small project I've been working on for a little while now. I'm learning OpenGL using GLAD, GLFW, and GLM.

If you would like to compile this, you will need to place your glad folder, glfw-3.3.5.bin.WIN64 foder, glm folder, ogl-master folder, and ogl-master-bin folder into the EvolutionSimulator folder. You can otherwise just relink the solution to where the files are located on your computer.
