# Evolution Simulator

Greetings! This is a project I've been working on for a while as a bit of a passion project. It started out as a way for me to learn how to use OpenGL and a couple of other libraries, but has turned into a project about simulating evolution through selective pressure and randomly generated mutations in the organisms' neural networks.

To run this, you will have to include the GLAD, GLFW-3.3.7, and GLM libraries.
