# OpenGLStuff
Hello! This is a small project I've been working on for a little while now. I'm learning OpenGL using GLAD, GLFW, and GLM.

If you would like to compile this, you will need to place your glad folder, glfw-3.3.5.bin.WIN64 foder, and glm folder folder into the EvolutionSimulator folder. You can otherwise just relink the solution to where the files are located on your computer. You'll also need to add appropriate libraries in the glfw-3.3.5.WIN64 folder to your additional library directories section.
